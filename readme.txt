== Assets Source ==

The JavaScript and CSS shipped in `assets/` are already in human-readable form.

There is no additional build step—what you see in that repo under `assets/`  
is exactly what runs on the site.

== External Services ==

This plugin relies on the Voicero.ai external API to power all of its AI features:

1. **Site Connection & Status**  
   - **Endpoint:**  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/connect` — validate and retrieve your website record.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/toggle-status` — activate or deactivate your site’s chat assistant.  
   - **Data Sent:** your Voicero access key, and on toggle-status calls your `websiteId`.  
   - **When:**  
     - On admin “Save & Connect” to link the plugin to your Voicero account.  
     - On admin “Activate/Deactivate” button clicks in the dashboard.

2. **Content Sync & Training**  
   - **Endpoints:**  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/sync` — send your site’s content payload (posts, pages, products, metadata) for indexing.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/vectorize` — request vector embeddings for that content.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/assistant` — set up your AI assistant after content is vectorized.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/train/page`  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/train/post`  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/train/product`  
       (each `/train/...` sends a single content item’s `wpId` plus `websiteId` to train on that entity)  
   - **Data Sent:**  
     - **Sync:** your entire site content (title, body, excerpts, taxonomy, custom fields).  
     - **Vectorize & Assistant:** no additional data beyond your `websiteId`.  
     - **Train:** individual content IDs (`wpId`) and `websiteId`.  
   - **When:** whenever you click **Sync Content Now** in the WP admin.

3. **Front-end Chat & Speech**  
   - **Endpoints:**  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/wordpress/chat` — send visitor messages plus `pageData` (URL, full text, buttons, forms, images) to generate responses.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/whisper` — send an uploaded audio file for speech-to-text transcription.  
     - `https://voicero.ai/api/tts` — sends answer response from chat to turn into a voice response   
   - **Data Sent:**  
     - Chat: user’s text message and contextual page data.  
     - Whisper: raw audio blob recorded by the visitor.  
   - **When:**  
     - Chat calls fire whenever a visitor submits a message in the on-site chat widget.  
     - Whisper calls fire whenever a visitor records and submits voice input.
